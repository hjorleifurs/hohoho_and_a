# hohoho_and_a
docker exorcism

walk this way: docker run --name hohoho --rm -d -p 8888:80 hjorleifur/hohoho_and_a

Then goto localhost:8888 (or whatever your machine is called)

8888=is the external port that you use to access the page

80=the internal port inside the docker it self

Other than that, there is nothing to see, please move along
